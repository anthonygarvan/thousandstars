# Thousand Stars

This code generates an static html page which displays all github repositories with over 1000 stars, sorted from most popular to least popular. 

View the page [here](http://anthonygarvan.github.io/thousandstars/).

I made this for my own enjoyment to get informed about what's going on in the open-source community.
